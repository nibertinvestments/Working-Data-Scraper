# Data Scraper Application Status

## ✅ FIXED AND WORKING

Your Data Scraper application is now fully functional! Here's what was fixed:

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Fixed preload script**: Changed from ES6 imports to CommonJS `require()` 
2. **Fixed IPC communication**: All IPC handlers are properly connected
3. **Fixed module loading**: DataScraper and all dependencies load correctly
4. **Added proper error handling**: Better logging and error recovery
5. **Created required directories**: data/, exports/, logs/ folders added

### Features Now Working:
- ✅ **Start/Stop Scraping**: Click "Start Scraping" to begin monitoring
- ✅ **Browser Monitoring**: Detects when you visit new websites
- ✅ **Contact Extraction**: Finds emails, phone numbers, and names
- ✅ **Data Storage**: Saves to SQLite database automatically
- ✅ **CSV Export**: Export your data to CSV files
- ✅ **Settings**: Configure what data to extract and export options
- ✅ **Real-time UI**: See scraped data appear in the table immediately

## How to Use:

1. **Start the app**: `npm start` (this now uses the fully working version)
2. **Click "Start Scraping"** in the app
3. **Browse websites** - the app will automatically extract contact info
4. **View collected data** in the main table
5. **Export data** using the export buttons
6. **Configure settings** using the settings button

## Current App Versions Available:

- `npm start` - **Full working version** (recommended)
- `npm run start-simple` - Basic version without scraping
- `npm run start-debug` - Debug version with extra logging
- `npm run start-original` - Original version (may have dependency issues)

## Google Sheets Integration:

The Google Sheets integration is ready but requires credentials setup:
1. Follow the guide in `credentials/README.md` 
2. Add your Google service account JSON file
3. The spreadsheet ID is already configured: `15rFNiDyUtp89RijmXNJidzon5RUpgdCalkU1JxeUNJY`

## Next Steps:

Your application is ready to use! You can now:
- Start scraping immediately with `npm start`
- Test the functionality by browsing websites
- Export your collected data as needed
- Set up Google Sheets integration if desired

The "Cannot read properties of undefined" error is completely resolved!
