# Data Scraper Assets

This directory contains application icons and other assets for the Data Scraper application.

## Required Icons

For a complete build, you'll need:

- `icon.png` - General purpose icon (256x256px recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon

## Icon Guidelines

The application icon should:
- Be recognizable at small sizes (16x16px)
- Use a simple, clear design
- Represent the data scraping/collection theme
- Work well on both light and dark backgrounds

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
1. Online icon generators (convert PNG to ICO/ICNS)
2. Design tools like GIMP, Photoshop, or Figma
3. Icon-specific tools like IconUtils (macOS) or IcoFX (Windows)

## Placeholder Note

Currently using placeholder icons. Replace with custom icons matching your brand/preferences.
